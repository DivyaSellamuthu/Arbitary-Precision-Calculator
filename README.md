Arbitrary Precision Calculator

An Arbitrary Precision Calculator is a command-line based application designed to perform arithmetic operations on numbers of unlimited length, overcoming the size limitations of standard built-in data types such as int or long.

This calculator represents numbers using dynamic data structures, enabling accurate computation on very large integers without loss of precision.
It supports fundamental arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, making it suitable for academic learning, competitive programming, and systems-level practice.

The project focuses on:

Handling large numbers digit by digit

Efficient memory management

Clear modular design for each operation


This implementation is ideal for understanding how high-precision arithmetic works internally and how calculators manage numbers beyond machine-level constraints.
